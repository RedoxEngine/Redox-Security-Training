# Goals and Structure
This course is designed to teach 

# Module 1: Security Fundamentals
This module is designed to introduce you to academic concepts in security. 
By the end of this module, you should be able to understand that security is fundamentally risk management. 
You will also have developed a vocabulary to talk about different kinds of security threats.
